# Job-Matching-and-Candidate-Analysis-Systems
The project aims to create a system that automates the analysis of job descriptions and resumes to find the best candidate-job matches. The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract meaningful information, such as required skills and experience, from unstructured text in job descriptions and resumes.
